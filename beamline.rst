Beamline API
============

Functionality that are considered to belong to the beamline as a whole,
incorporating several different instruments or that does not necessarily
belong to one particular instrument.


List of Actuators:
------------------

Below a list of all known actuators, including those that might logically
be associated with the SampleChanger of Diffractometer, as well as more
generally with the beamline.


**Actuators - Type float:**

    *Diffractometer motors*

        omega, kappa, kappa_phi, alignment_ver, alignment_hor, alignment_depth,
        centring_vertical, centring_horizontal, centring_depth, focus

    *Detector motors*

        detector_distance, two_theta, detector_horizontal, detector_vertical

        detector_distance may be the only common one, but the others are
        defined for future needs.

    *Beamline parameters*

        resolution, energy, wavelength, transmission

    *Light intensity*

        frontlight_intensity, backlight_intensity


**Actuators - Type Tuple[float, float]:**

    *Standard parameters*

        beam_size, beam_position

    *Expert parameters (optional)*

        aperture, slits

        These are included only to standardize the names. The specific
        beam-defining motors are likely to vary between beamlines,
        and many beamlines will not support these in the user interface,
        while others would use more or different actuators.


**Actuators - Type str:**

    *Enumerated strings*

        zoom, phase, centring_method, beam_shape

        These must all have a allowed_values or enum


**Actuators - Type TwoState**

    fast_shutter, safety_shutter, beamstop, capillary, frontlight, backlight

    These are all two-state actuators. Their value will be of type
    TwoStateValue. Their state is set to ActuatorState, though one could
    limit it to a subset: NOTINITIALIZED, UNUSABLE, READY, MOVING, FROZEN


**Immovable actuators**

    - machine_current:float

    - photon_flux:float

    - fill_mode:str

    - beam_divergence:Tuple[float,float]

Signal handlers:
----------------

    Functions with the following signatures have to be provided by the specific
    UI Layer in order

    to handle the various errors, state changes or simply progress messages that
    are sent by the actions initiated by the functions above. These are the
    generic signals that can be sent by a procedure or actuator, each of which
    can have their own specific signals that have to be handled separately
    (should be documented with the corresponding procedure or actuator)

    +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | Signal Name               | Handler                               |
    +===========================+=======================================+
    | procedureStateChanged     | procedure_state_changed_handler       |
    +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | procedureProgress         | procedure_progress_handler            |
    +---------------------------+---------------------------------------+
    | actuatorStateChanged      | actuator_state_changed                |

    | actuatorValueChanged      | actuator_value_changed_handler        |
